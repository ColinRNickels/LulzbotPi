## Overview

The NCSU Libraries' [D. H. Hill Library Makerspace](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/do/make-at-hill) is a hands on DIY style makerspace. We have 12 [Lulzbot Mini](https://www.lulzbot.com/store/printers/lulzbot-mini) 3D Printers that we allow students to use themselves. While we do provide training and one on one assistance, our users experienced failure frequently due to software issues on our MacBook Air computers running [Cura Lulzbot Edition](https://www.lulzbot.com/cura). Additionally, the need to constantly tether these 3D printers to full size laptops limited the amount of space available for other projects. We decided we needed a new method of running these printers that was smaller, more reliable, and easy to use. This is the result of that project.
